# Gregory's Bad Bank
## Description
My version of the Bad Bank application - submitted as the portfolio project for Part 2 - Front-End Development with React, from MIT XPro's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full-Stack Development with MERN course.

Bad Bank is so-named because it has no security. This application allows anyone to create an account, deposit and withdraw "money," and view all the information of each and every user

## Learning Objectives
In addition to showcasing my ability to use React, this project challenged me to:
    - Learn (and re-learn) routing for single page applications
    - Transfer a project from React standalone to Create React App
    - Separate components into individual files and consider where and when to import them
    - Consider where and how to hold context
    - Deploy a static website via AWS

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Future planned improvements include:
    - Adding the option to open different types of accounts (ie: checking, savings)
    - Adding the ability to transfer funds between users
    - Adding a logout option to the navigation bar that is conditional upon whether a user is logged in or not
    - Integration with a database subject to learning in Part 3 of this course.

## How to Run
Download/clone the repository to your local machine, and follow the boiler-plate Create React App instructions included below:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
